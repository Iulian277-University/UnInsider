# UnInsider

UnInsider is a web platform designed to allow students to submit reviews for their universities, as well as like or dislike existing reviews submitted by other students. Additionally, administrators have the ability to create new universities on the platform and have access to all functionalities available to registered students. A machine learning model will also be integrated to summarize the top reviews for each university, making it easier for students to get an idea about any university quickly.
